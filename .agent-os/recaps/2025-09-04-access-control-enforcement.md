# Task Completion Recap: Access Control Enforcement for Media Visibility

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**GitHub Issue**: #69  
**Feature Branch**: feature/chakaiki-pdf-access  
**Pull Request**: #76

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive access control enforcement for media visibility, ensuring proper authentication and authorization across the application.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Media Detail Page Access Control (`/app/media/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added authentication checks using `currentUserEmail`, `requireAdmin`, `requireOwner`
- Implemented tiered access control system:
  - **Privileged users** (admin/owner): Full access to any media
  - **Public media**: Accessible to anyone
  - **Private media**: Requires user to be attendee of related chakai events
- Added proper permission verification before allowing media access
- Returns 404 for unauthorized access attempts

### 2. Chakai Search API Enhancement (`/app/api/search/chakai/route.ts`)
- Added authentication and authorization middleware
- Implemented visibility-based filtering:
  - **Anonymous users**: Can only see public and open events
  - **Authenticated users**: Can see public, open, and member events they attend
  - **Privileged users**: Can see all events without restriction
- Added attendee verification for member-only events
- Removed internal visibility field from API responses for security

## Technical Implementation

### Access Control Logic
- Leveraged existing authentication infrastructure
- Used database queries to verify event attendance for private media access
- Implemented cascading permission checks (privileged → public → attendance-based)

### Security Enhancements
- Protected internal visibility fields from public API responses
- Added proper 404 responses instead of revealing existence of unauthorized content
- Ensured all access paths are properly validated

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Application builds successfully for production
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met:
  - Access control logic implemented for media visibility
  - Attendees can access private media for their events only
  - Public users see only public media
  - Owners/admins have full access to chakai media
  - API endpoints enforce visibility rules

## Impact

This implementation ensures that sensitive private media is only accessible to authorized users while maintaining a seamless experience for public content consumption. The feature provides the foundation for member-only content management within the tea ceremony collection system.

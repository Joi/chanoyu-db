# 2025-09-01 Recap: Minimal UI Polish (joi.ito.com aesthetic)

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-minimal-ui-polish/spec.md.

## Recap

The UI was aligned to a minimal joi.ito.com-inspired aesthetic: serif headings, neutral sans body text, classic web-blue links, hairline separators, and whitespace-driven layout using Tailwind tokens. Core primitives were implemented and existing screens updated to improve visual consistency, accessibility, and performance while keeping the app responsive.

- Implemented theme tokens (colors, separators, spacing)
- Configured next/font for Inter, EB Garamond, Noto Sans JP, Noto Serif JP
- Built UI primitives: Container, Title, Muted, Separator, Button
- Applied global typography and link styles (hover underline, focus-visible ring)
- Polished header/nav; ensured role-aware visibility tests pass
- Verified tests pass and maintained performance/accessibility guardrails

## Context

Make the tea-collection site feel like joi.ito.com: serif titles, neutral sans body, classic blue links, thin separators, whitespace-driven layout. Use Tailwind tokens + fonts (Inter/Noto Sans JP, EB Garamond/Noto Serif JP). Build small primitives, polish object index/detail, and add minimal header/search nav. No backend changes.

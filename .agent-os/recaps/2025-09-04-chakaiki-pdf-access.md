# [2025-09-04] Recap: Database Schema for Media Visibility Controls

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-04-chakaiki-pdf-access/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the foundational database schema changes to enable media visibility controls for the chakaiki PDF access feature. This work establishes the infrastructure needed for fine-grained access control of chakai media files, including both existing images and future PDF documents.

Key accomplishments:
- Added visibility enum type (public/private) to media tables
- Created comprehensive migration script with backward compatibility
- Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Established proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Created chakai_media table for PDF attachments
- Implemented RLS policies for access control enforcement
- Added performance indexes for efficient queries

## Context

Enable chakai owners/admins to upload PDF files to tea ceremony events with public/private visibility controls, extending existing media system to ensure attendees can access private materials while public users only see public content.

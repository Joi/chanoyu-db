### 2. Visibility Management System
- Added visibility badges (üîí PRIVATE / üåê PUBLIC) on each media item
- Implemented individual visibility toggle controls for each media item
- Created server actions for single item visibility updates
- Enhanced UI with clear visual indicators for media privacy status

### 3. Bulk Operations Framework
- Added "Select All" checkbox functionality for mass operations
- Implemented individual item selection with checkboxes
- Created bulk visibility update functionality
- Added server actions for bulk operations with proper error handling
- Enhanced UX with selection state management

### 4. Advanced Filtering System
- Added visibility filtering (public/private media)
- Implemented file type filtering (PDFs/images/other)
- Created dropdown filter controls with clear options
- Enhanced media discovery and organization capabilities

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- Improved responsive design with better grid layout
- Enhanced media card design with better information hierarchy
- Added proper loading states and user feedback
- Fixed Next.js compatibility issues with event handlers
- Implemented consistent styling across all components

## Technical Implementation

### Server Actions
- Created `updateMediaVisibility` for individual item updates
- Implemented `updateBulkMediaVisibility` for mass operations
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Used Supabase service client for admin operations

### State Management
- Implemented React state for selection tracking
- Added filtering state management with URL synchronization
- Created efficient re-rendering with proper dependency arrays
- Used optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### File Type Handling
- Enhanced PDF detection with proper MIME type checking
- Improved media preview system for different file types
- Added fallback displays for unsupported file types
- Implemented consistent file type indicators

## Verification

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ‚úÖ Application builds successfully for production
- ‚úÖ All acceptance criteria met:
  - PDF files are properly detected and displayed with red preview cards
  - Individual visibility controls work for each media item
  - Bulk operations (Select All + bulk visibility updates) function correctly
  - Filtering by visibility and file type works as expected
  - UI is responsive and user-friendly
  - Server actions handle errors gracefully

## Impact

This implementation provides administrators with comprehensive tools to manage media collections efficiently. The PDF support enables proper handling of document-type media, while bulk operations significantly improve workflow efficiency. The enhanced filtering and visibility controls ensure proper content organization and access management within the tea ceremony collection system.

# Task Completion Recap: Complete Chakai Media Upload Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**GitHub Issue**: #63  
**Feature Branch**: feature/chakaiki-pdf-access  
**Pull Request**: #79

## Summary

Successfully implemented complete chakai media upload functionality including PDF support, access controls, and comprehensive admin interface. This builds on the database schema foundation and provides end-to-end file upload, management, and access control capabilities for chakai records.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Media Upload API (`/app/api/chakai/[id]/media/route.ts`)
- Implemented POST endpoint for file uploads with validation
- Added DELETE endpoint for media removal with cleanup  
- File type validation (PDF, images) with size limits (50MB)
- Proper error handling and response formatting
- Integration with Supabase Storage and database

### 2. MediaUpload Component (`/app/components/MediaUpload.tsx`)
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- File validation with user feedback
- Public/private visibility toggle controls
- Progress indication and error handling
- Reusable component design for chakai integration

### 3. Admin Integration (`/app/admin/chakai/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Full integration of MediaUpload component into chakai edit page
- Current attachments display with management controls
- File removal functionality with confirmation
- Enhanced chakai admin interface for media management

### 4. Access Control Implementation (`/app/chakai/[id]/page.tsx`, `/app/media/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Implemented attendee-based access control for private media
- Public/private visibility enforcement through RLS policies
- Proper authorization checks for media access
- Integration with existing chakai visibility system

### 5. Database Schema & Migration Fixes
- Resolved migration conflicts with comprehensive schema rebuild
- Created idempotent migrations with IF NOT EXISTS clauses
- Fixed Supabase preview database compatibility issues
- Proper constraint and index management

## Technical Implementation

### Database Foundation
- Enhanced media table with file metadata (file_type, file_size, original_filename)
- chakai_media_links table for many-to-many relationships
- RLS policies enforcing visibility and attendee access rules
- Performance indexes for efficient media queries

### File Upload System  
- Secure file validation and sanitization
- Supabase Storage integration for file persistence
- Database linkage with proper cleanup on deletion
- Support for multiple file types with size restrictions

### Access Control Architecture
- Role-based permissions (admin/owner/attendee/public)
- Dynamic visibility control based on chakai membership
- Secure media serving through existing media API endpoints
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts

## Database Migration Resolution

Fixed critical migration issues that were preventing Supabase preview deployments:
- Replaced fragmented migration files with single comprehensive schema
- Added IF NOT EXISTS clauses for idempotent operations
- Resolved "relation already exists" errors in preview environments
- Ensured compatibility with Supabase's branching workflow

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Application builds successfully for production  
- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ Supabase migration errors resolved
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met:
  - PDF and image upload to chakai records
  - Granular access controls (public/private visibility)
  - Role-based permissions enforcement
  - Admin interface integration
  - Proper file management and cleanup

## Impact

This implementation completes the chakai media upload feature requested in Issue #63. Administrators can now upload PDF documents and images to chakai records with fine-grained visibility controls. The system properly enforces access based on chakai attendee status while maintaining public access for open content. The migration fixes ensure reliable deployment through Supabase's preview system.

# Product Mission (Lite)

Chanoyu DB is a bilingual EN/JA collections and event system for Japanese tea ceremony that gives stable, canonical IDs and Linked Art JSON-LD for utensils, people, chakai, and tea rooms with fine-grained visibility controls.

It serves collectors, tea schools, and researchers who need durable links and interoperable data. Unlike generic CMSs, Chanoyu DB bridges curated Local Classes to AAT/Wikidata, publishes machine-readable JSON-LD per item, and enforces access via RLS for members-only or admin-only content.

> Spec: RLS Performance Optimization
> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) performance warnings by consolidating multiple permissive policies on key tables. The current implementation has overlapping policies that create unnecessary query complexity and performance degradation while maintaining the same security boundaries.

## User Stories

As a developer, I want to eliminate RLS performance warnings so that database queries execute efficiently without compromising security.

As a system administrator, I want consolidated RLS policies that are easier to understand and maintain while preserving the existing access control model.

As an end user, I want faster page load times when browsing chakai events and local classes due to optimized database queries.

## Spec Scope

- Consolidate multiple permissive policies on `chakai_items` table:
  - `chakai_items_admin_read`
  - `chakai_items_admin_write` 
  - `chakai_items_read`
- Consolidate multiple permissive policies on `local_classes` table:
  - `local_classes_admin_all`
  - `local_classes_public_read`
- Create migration scripts to safely transition from current to optimized policies
- Verify that existing access patterns continue to work correctly
- Document the consolidated policy logic for future maintenance

## Out of Scope

- Changes to application-level authorization logic
- Modifications to user roles or permissions structure
- Performance optimization of other database tables not mentioned in warnings
- UI/UX changes related to data access

## Expected Deliverable

- Database migration files that drop existing overlapping policies and create consolidated replacements
- Updated RLS policy documentation
- Verification tests to ensure security boundaries remain intact
- Performance improvement measurements before and after optimization

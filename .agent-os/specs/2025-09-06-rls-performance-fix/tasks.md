# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-rls-performance-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation
- [ ] **Document current RLS policies**: Extract and document exact logic of all existing policies on chakai_items and local_classes tables
- [ ] **Analyze policy overlap**: Identify specific overlapping conditions causing performance warnings
- [ ] **Map access patterns**: Document which user roles access which data under current policies
- [ ] **Create test scenarios**: Develop comprehensive test cases for admin, authenticated, and anonymous users

### Phase 2: Local Development and Testing  
- [ ] **Design consolidated policies**: Create optimized policy logic that maintains identical access control
- [ ] **Write migration scripts**: Create both forward and rollback migration files
- [ ] **Test in local Docker**: Apply migrations to local Supabase instance and verify functionality
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking**: Measure query performance before and after consolidation
- [ ] **Regression testing**: Run full application test suite to ensure no functional changes

### Phase 3: Implementation and Deployment
- [ ] **Create production backup**: Backup production database before applying changes
- [ ] **Deploy migration**: Apply consolidated RLS policies to production during maintenance window
- [ ] **Post-deployment verification**: Verify all access patterns work correctly in production
- [ ] **Monitor performance**: Track query performance improvements and error rates
- [ ] **Update documentation**: Document final consolidated policy structure for future reference

### Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup
- [ ] **Validate security boundaries**: Confirm no unauthorized access is possible with new policies
- [ ] **Performance measurement**: Document actual performance improvements achieved
- [ ] **Create rollback procedure**: Finalize and document rollback process for future reference
- [ ] **Update development workflow**: Update local development setup to use optimized policies

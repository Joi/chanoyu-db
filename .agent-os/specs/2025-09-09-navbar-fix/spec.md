> Spec: Navigation Header Bug Fix & Navbar Improvement
> Created: 2025-09-09

## Overview

Fix the navigation header bug where clicking the 'Ito Chanoyu' logo triggers a download dialog instead of navigating to the home page, particularly on individual profile pages. Revamp the navbar with proper navigation components and pulldown menus.

## User Stories

### Logo Navigation Fix
As a user, I want to click the site logo to navigate to the home page, so that I can quickly return to the main site from any page without triggering unwanted downloads.

Users should be able to click the 'Ito Chanoyu' logo from any page, including profile pages, and be taken to the home page (/) without any download dialogs appearing.

### Improved Navigation
As a user, I want a clear navigation bar with organized menu options, so that I can easily navigate between different sections of the site.

Users should have access to a well-structured navbar with pulldown menus for organized navigation to key site sections.

## Spec Scope

1. **Logo Navigation Bug Fix** - Resolve the download dialog issue when clicking the site logo
2. **Navbar Component Cleanup** - Revamp existing navigation components to eliminate conflicts
3. **Pulldown Menu Implementation** - Add organized pulldown menus for better navigation structure
4. **Cross-page Testing** - Ensure navigation works consistently across all page types

## Out of Scope

- Major design overhaul beyond fixing the navigation issue
- Mobile-responsive navigation improvements (unless required for the bug fix)
- Authentication-related navigation changes
- Backend navigation logic changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. Logo click navigates to home page without download dialogs on all pages including profile pages
2. Functional navbar with pulldown menus accessible from all site pages

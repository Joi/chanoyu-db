- [x] Ensure consistent styling and information presentation
- [x] Maintain existing admin functionality while adding enhancements
- [x] Test admin workflow compatibility

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Task 4.1: Component Testing** ✅
- [x] Test gallery with objects having 1, 2, 5, and 10+ images
- [x] Verify thumbnail navigation works correctly
- [x] Test responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [x] Verify image loading performance and optimization

**Task 4.2: Hierarchy Display Testing** ✅
- [x] Test with objects having different hierarchy depths (1-4 levels)
- [x] Verify breadcrumb display for objects without parent classes
- [x] Test hierarchy display consistency between public and admin views
- [x] Ensure proper fallback handling for missing class data

**Task 4.3: Regression Testing** ✅
- [x] Test existing object view functionality remains intact
- [x] Test image upload and management workflows (should be unaffected)
- [x] Confirm admin object management workflows work properly
- [x] Validate responsive design across different devices

## Implementation Summary

All tasks have been successfully completed as part of GitHub Issue #112. Key deliverables include:

1. **ObjectImageGallery Component**: Complete React component with thumbnail navigation and responsive design
2. **Enhanced Object View**: Updated `/app/id/[token]/page.tsx` with gallery integration
3. **Class Hierarchy Display**: Breadcrumb-style hierarchy showing parent → child relationships
4. **Admin Page Updates**: Consistent hierarchy display across admin interfaces
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test pass rate with responsive design validation

The implementation maintains backwards compatibility and includes proper error handling for edge cases.

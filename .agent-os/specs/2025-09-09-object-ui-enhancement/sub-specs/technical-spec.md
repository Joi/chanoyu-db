This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-object-ui-enhancement/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-09
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Create ObjectImageGallery React component with thumbnail grid and main image display
- Implement click handlers for thumbnail navigation with current image state management
- Modify object view page to replace single image with gallery component
- Query and display complete class hierarchy using existing local_class_hierarchy closure table
- Ensure responsive grid layout for thumbnails (4-8 columns based on screen size)
- Maintain existing 4:3 aspect ratio consistency for thumbnails
- Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing and optimization
- Apply hierarchy display enhancements to both public and admin object pages
- Implement visual indicators for current selected thumbnail
- Add image counter display for multi-image objects

## Approach

### Gallery Component Architecture
1. Create `ObjectImageGallery` component that accepts media array prop
2. Use React useState to track currently selected image
3. Render main image container with Next.js Image component
4. Generate thumbnail grid with responsive CSS Grid layout
5. Implement click handlers that update selected image state

### Class Hierarchy Implementation
1. Utilize existing `local_class_hierarchy` closure table relationships
2. Build breadcrumb-style display showing: Root Class > Parent Class > Child Class
3. Apply consistent styling across both public view and admin pages
4. Use existing classification data without requiring schema changes

### Component Integration
1. Replace single image displays in `/app/id/[token]/page.tsx` with gallery component
2. Update admin object pages to include hierarchy breadcrumbs
3. Maintain backwards compatibility for objects with single images
4. Ensure proper loading states and error handling

## External Dependencies

- Next.js Image component for optimized image rendering
- Existing Tailwind CSS classes for responsive grid layouts

> Spec: Object UI Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the object viewing experience by adding thumbnail image galleries and improved class hierarchy display to prevent UI regression while upgrading functionality.

## User Stories

### Gallery Navigation
As a user viewing an object, I want to see thumbnails of all available images in a gallery format, so that I can easily browse through multiple images of the same object.

When viewing an object with multiple images, users will see a main image display with thumbnail navigation below. Clicking any thumbnail updates the main image display.

### Class Hierarchy Visibility  
As a user viewing objects with hierarchical classifications, I want to see the complete parent class chain in addition to the assigned class, so that I understand the full classification context and nesting structure.

Users will see both the specific assigned class and its parent hierarchy displayed clearly in both public object view and admin pages.

## Spec Scope

1. **Thumbnail Gallery Component** - Create an image gallery with thumbnails and main image display for object view pages
2. **Click Navigation** - Enable clicking thumbnails to change the main displayed image  
3. **Class Hierarchy Display** - Show parent classes in addition to assigned child classes with clear nesting indication
4. **Admin Page Consistency** - Apply hierarchy improvements to both object view and admin object pages
5. **Responsive Gallery Design** - Ensure gallery works properly across different screen sizes

## Out of Scope

- Image upload functionality modifications
- Major admin interface restructuring  
- New image management features
- Performance optimizations beyond basic responsive loading

## Expected Deliverable

1. Object pages with multiple images display thumbnail galleries with working click navigation
2. Objects with hierarchical classes show complete parent chain from root to assigned class
3. Admin object pages consistently display the same hierarchy information as public pages

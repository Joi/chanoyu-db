# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Profile & Friends System Completion
> Created: 2025-09-09

## Overview

Complete the database profile system and friends functionality that enables members to connect, manage profile pictures, and tag each other in media content. This work builds on existing implementation from GitHub issues #107 and #110 to finalize the member interaction features.

## User Stories

### Profile Management
As a member, I want to upload and manage my profile picture, so that other members can easily identify me in the community.

Members can upload profile pictures through the profile interface, with images stored in Supabase storage and referenced in the accounts table.

### Friend Connections
As a member, I want to send and receive friend requests, so that I can build my network within the tea ceremony community.

Members can discover other members, send friend requests, accept/decline requests, and manage their friend connections through a dedicated interface.

### Media Tagging
As a member, I want to tag friends in media content, so that we can associate people with specific tea gathering moments and objects.

Members can tag other members in photos and media, creating connections between people and content within the platform.

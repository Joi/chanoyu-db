# Simplify Git Workflow - Lite Summary

Streamline development by eliminating the dev branch as an intermediary step, enabling direct feature branch to main PRs while maintaining proper CI/CD practices and preview deployments.

## Key Points
- Remove dev branch from workflow: feature branch → main (instead of feature branch → dev → main)
- Update CI/CD workflows to handle direct PRs to main with proper preview deployments
- Simplify documentation and instructions across CLAUDE.md, README.md, and agent-os files
- Maintain all quality gates and testing requirements while reducing merge complexity

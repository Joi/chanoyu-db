> Spec: joi.ito.com Design System Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Transform the chanoyu collection site to adopt joi.ito.com's refined design language, featuring the signature color palette, typography system, and visual patterns, while implementing enhanced deployment automation and operational capabilities.

## User Stories

### Design System Consistency
As a visitor, I want the chanoyu site to feel cohesive with joi.ito.com's design language so that it maintains brand consistency across Joi's digital properties.

The site will adopt joi.ito.com's signature #fafafa background, blue accent palette (#1A80B4/#0299ce), Avenir/Montserrat typography, gradient headers, and 20px rounded corner patterns. This creates visual continuity across the digital ecosystem while respecting the unique content focus of the tea collection.

### Enhanced Deployment Experience
As a developer, I want automated deployment workflows that match joi.ito.com's operational standards so that updates are reliable, traceable, and professionally managed.

Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows will handle automated testing, preview deployments, and production releases with proper monitoring and rollback capabilities.

### Professional Visual Quality
As a curator, I want the collection interface to reflect museum-quality presentation standards so that it properly showcases the cultural significance of the tea ceremony artifacts.

Refined spacing, sophisticated color usage, and elevated typography will create a presentation worthy of the collection's cultural importance.

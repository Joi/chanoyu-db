# Create Spec

Create a detailed spec for a new feature with technical specifications and task breakdown

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
@.agent-os/instructions/core/create-spec.md

## Optional bootstrap

If you already have a slug and title, you can have me create a feature branch, spec stub, an initial Spec issue, and a draft PR:

```bash
scripts/feature-bootstrap.sh <slug> "Human-friendly feature title"
```

I'll ask before running it. Ensure `gh` (GitHub CLI) is installed and authenticated.

# DEPRECATED: Local Classes TODO moved

This file is deprecated. The canonical task list is in `TASKS.md`.

- Use `TASKS.md` → Backlog → "Feature: Local Classes (Metaclassification)" for the merged checklist
- Rationale: maintaining a single source of truth for work items

If you landed here from an old link, open `TASKS.md` instead.

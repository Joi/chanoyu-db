# DEPRECATED â€” Use GitHub Issues

This file is no longer the source of truth for planning. Please use GitHub Issues with labels (e.g., `feature:your-slug`, `type:*`, `area:*`, `priority:*`, `state:*`).

Spec documents live under `.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` and should be linked from the initial Spec issue.
